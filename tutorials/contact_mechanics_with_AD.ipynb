    "The wrapping of a function in the pp.ad.Function class may be slightly confusing in that the function (e.g. `pp.ad.functions.max`) takes an `AdArray` as its argument, whereas the Function instance (e.g. `MaxAd` above) expects an `Operator`, which represents an ad variable or compound expression. The explanation lies in how the Function is *parsed* (\"evaluated\"), which involves the `MaxAd` asking its `_function` to operate on the values and jacobians of `var0` and `var1`, which are represented through an `AdArray`. Puh!\n",
