### Synthetic problems via manufactured solutions

- **manu_flow_incomp_frac**: Manufactured solution for the incompressible flow in a 
  two-dimensional domain hosting a single, fully embedded vertical fracture.

- **manu_flow_comp_frac**: Manufactured solution for the compressible flow in a 
  two-dimensional domain hosting a single, fully embedded vertical fracture.

- **manu_poromech_nofrac**: Manufactured solutions for non-linear poromechanics (the 
  non-linearity is included through the fluid compressibility) in a unit square.

### Classical problems

- **terzaghi_biot**: Implementation of Terzaghi's consolidation problem in a 
  pseudo one-dimensional domain.

- **mandel_biot**: Implementation of Mandel's problem of poroelasticity.
